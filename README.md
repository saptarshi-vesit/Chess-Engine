# Chess-Engine-Project
 ## Chess Engine
 - A [chess engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_engine) is a computer program that analyzes chess or chess variant positions, and generates a move or a list of moves that it regards as strongest against an opponent. Today chess engines are widely used among chess enthusiasts and professionals alike to compete against other individuals virtually and also to train themselves and learn new techniques by playing against bots.
 - The Chess engine built here allows the player to compete against another player or play against the computer, whose level of difficulty can be varied. There are four levels of difficulty that have been decided based on number of moves that the algorithm can compute. AI algorithms such as [Mini-Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and [Alpha-Beta Pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) has been implemented to design the bot player.
 - I have tried to emulate the look and feel of popular chess engines available in websites like [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/), [chesskid.com](https://www.chesskid.com/), etc by adding features such as move highlighting, piece animation, move log display, etc.
 
 ## Tools and Technologies Used
 The project has exclusively made use of [Python Programming language](https://docs.python.org/3/) to build the program. [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/), a module in Python was used for game development. I have used pygame because of simplicity of syntax and it's beginner friendly approach to basic game programming with multiple built-in features. It can run on any environment and has an exhuastive documentation thus making it easy to search for specific predefined functions and classes.
